# [Testific.at](//testific.at)
## A/B testing for ~~cats~~ people

> Enter two or more cases to create a test. Give the URL out to friends, coworkers, colleagues, and other felines. Take a coffee. Have a lasagna. Come back to simple stats. Easy as 1-2-3. 

- The code is somewhat horrible right now.
- The [API](https://github.com/passcod/testificat/blob/master/main.rb#L139-L329) is *way* more powerful than the UI lets on.
- The [user detection thing](https://github.com/passcod/testificat/blob/master/main.rb#L55-L94) is a bit broken.
- It's usable [right now](//ab.testific.at).
- More features and fixes to come!
