    Enter two or more cases to create a test. Give the
    URL out to friends, coworkers, colleagues, and other
    felines. Take a coffee. Have a lasagna. Come back to
    simple stats. Easy as 1-2-3.
  %p
    Don't put numbers or ordering information in the test
    cases. They will be randomised for every person to
    avoid bias.
  %p
    You can use
    %a{href: 'http://daringfireball.net/markdown/'} markdown
    (or just plain text) in text fields. There are various
    extensions enabled, like&nbsp;
    %span{style: 'border: 1px solid gray'}> tables
    ,
    = Sanitize.clean(mkd('~~deletions~~, ^(superscripts) and ==highlights==.'), elements: %w[del mark sup])
    Autolinking is also available.
  %p
    If you wish to put a title on a test case, use markdown's
    %code # Title
    (or underline the title with
    %code =====
    if you prefer). Again, to avoid bias, if you use such a title
    on a test case, you may want to do so for all, or none at all.
  %p
    If you have added too many test cases, simply leave
    each extra one empty, and it will not be taken into
    account. Of course, this means you cannot have empty
    test cases.
